# Tracks
A side project: possibly an app to track multiple people on map

1. Setup VSCode and git to be able to sync to the repo. Needed to generate an ssh key pair on my system, add the public key to my github account. Didn't give any passphrase.
2. Had to update npm locally only for this repo, as this is my office system, and I have an older version globally.
3. Had to point the local npm to local .npmrc, with default registry, not the company's artifactory
4. npm install expo-cli
5. npx create-expo-app tracks
